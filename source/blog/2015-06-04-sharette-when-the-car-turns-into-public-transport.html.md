[Sharette](https://sharette.fr){:target="_blank"} is a smartphone app connecting drivers and passengers for short-distance rides in Paris area. The app shows itineraries combining carpooling ride and public transports to optimize the ways of commuting around Paris. Local, and instantaneous, Sharette is a smart answer to the commuting needs in Ile-de-France. Economical, carpooling with Sharette costs 2€ to the passenger, regardless from the distance driven (plus 0,36 € as booking fees). Sharette yearns to rethink private car as a public transportation.  

Sharette aimed to go from a “garage” startup to a startup ready to face a public launch this summer. So, we needed a scalable and profitable business model. We also needed coaching to manage our partnership with a big company, la RATP. Finally, NUMA has been a precious support and advisor during our second fundraising. 

We learn a lot from the [NUMA Sprint](http://www.numa.paris/sprint/){:target="_blank"}, thanks to active mentors in each field : HR, strategy, product, tech, open innovation, etc). Moreover, we now have a incredible network supporting our growth. Finally, NUMA teaches you personally how to be strong enough to overcome problems encountered all your entrepreneurial journey. 

Sharette has got quite an agenda since we left NUMA : public launch in Ile-de-France and a second fundraising (750K). We also hired a communication manager and a lead developer to strengthen the team for the take-off this summer.
