#####AMBITION
{:.sm-head}

In the context of questioning its future business model, L’Equipe envisioned to leverage the 20th Soccer World Cup in Brazil and its archives to provide new content based on these data.

#####ACTION
{:.sm-head}

In collaboration with NUMA, we develop a program in 2 phases:
–a 48 hours hackathon to help emerge and prototype new ways and means to give coverage to the worldwide event;
–followed by a 5 days bootcamp to jump from the prototype to  a ready-to-go-to-market product.

#####IMPACT
{:.sm-head}

The program ended up with 2 finalized products [Mundial Memories](http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Coupe-du-monde/Mundial-Memories/){:target="_blank"} and Mythe ou Mytho.
In addition, L’Equipe is working with us on putting in place new short track program involving external stakeholders and they engage a restructuration of their databases.
