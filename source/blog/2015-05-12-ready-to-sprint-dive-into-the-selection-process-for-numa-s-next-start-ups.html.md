![NUMA Sprint Jury](numa_sprint_jury.jpg)

As most of the tech ecosystem is now aware of, NUMA is accelerating and launching a very innovative equity-crowdfunding campaign to provide itself with the means to extend its model to the entire world within a few years!
Not only we recently opened a brand new NUMA Moscow, but we also are seeing things big as we plan on opening no less than 15 other Tech Hubs before 2019! 
This is how we see acceleration at NUMA. 

## Be ambitious, and give yourself the means to achieve it.

###We gathered amazing internationational jury members for this new season:

- Startups coming by NUMA for the selections those last weeks have met the following people from various part of the worldâ€¦
