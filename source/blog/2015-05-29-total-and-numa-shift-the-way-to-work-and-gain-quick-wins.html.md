#####AMBITION
{:.sm-head}

The IT department came in with 2 teams to work on 2 different problems:
–a lack of understanding internally on the role and functions of the IT department;
–design a process that will allow identification and management of IT projects off the usual track and collaborating with an external ecosystem.

#####ACTION
{:.sm-head}

Program was run in 2 steps in October 2014:
–train the team through hands on workshops on lean product development;
–accelerate the projects applying lean approach including user research to challenge assumptions and prototypes and allow tests and iterations.
Each team was responsible for its own solution and supported by a team of entrepreneur-mentor. Occasionally experts from our network (UX designer, developer, etc.) would join the teams to recreate conditions of a design studio.

Les équipes n’étaient pas en concurrence, chacune responsable d’un projet, elles étaient accompagnées par un mentor-entrepreneur et, ponctuellement, par des experts (UX designer, développeur, etc.) de notre réseau.

#####IMPACT
{:.sm-head}

Both prototypes are under development for implementation and this program will be renewed in 2015. Total also thinks of new externalised format programs to lead at NUMA.

*The result of this program was amazing because the work of these two teams will be directly usable, and also because of the method that NUMA taught us. Everything that was told to us during the program made me realize the relevance of working closely with startups and use startups method.*
