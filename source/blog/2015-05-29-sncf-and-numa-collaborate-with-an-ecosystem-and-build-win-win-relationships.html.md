#####AMBITION
{:.sm-head}

Being a leader in mobility, SNCF has massive data that were not exploited back in 2013. Looking for new business models, the company sow in giving access to its data an opportunity to develop new products or services.

#####ACTION
{:.sm-head}

Called the Data Shaker, NUMA conceived a 6 months experimentation program built on the core theme ‘Personalised mobility’. It provides a structure for collaboration between:
–**Project leaders** working on new solutions but missing use cases to test and validate their intuitions;
–A **cross and deep involvement** from the SNCF committed with 8 departments and affiliates on providing multiple ressources (data, uses cases, technical expertises etc.);
–Mentors from our ecosystem to support project teams.

#####IMPACT
{:.sm-head}

20 projects came out this open innovation program and 6 were selected for further development like SNCF Maps (live mapping of the trains) or the SNCF Library (digital content that fit the time of the journey).
SCNF also went further with a complete cultural shift. They now have a complete new organisation including Traveller experience departments and Transparency. An open data online platform is now available: <https://data.sncf.com/>

> Data Shaker moved us out of our comfort zone. It was an opportunity to have our operational teams collaborating with external project leaders who shake us up but together we developed viable projects. <cite>Régine Combremont, directrice de la Fabrique Digitale chez SNCF</cite>
