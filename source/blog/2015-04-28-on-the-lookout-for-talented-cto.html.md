How does NUMA launch new programs? When we detect a need no one in the ecosystem provides an answer to **Adopt a CTO** 

Some events that NUMA created met such a success within the community that they became recurring and expected meetings; “Adopt a CTO” is certainly one of the best examples.

Back in 2013, Le Camping kicks off its 4th season. As always, one problem persists for startuppers: finding a technical manager. Indeed, finding a good CTO (chief technical officer) is never an easy task. And, to quote Alexis Ohanian from Reddit: “*Ideas are cheap. Execution is what matters.*” Brilliant ideas are legion; the technical teams to implement them are rather scarce. There was the idea behind “Adopt a CTO”.

The concept is quite simple: startups pitch their ideas in 1 minute in front of a curious crowd of web developers, as they would in front of investors. The more convincing the pitch, the more chances of leveraging a technical partner the startups get. This startups/CTO speed-dating was met with an immediate success: *“We expected about 30 candidates for the first edition, and 150 people booked a seat”* confesses Elise Nebout, manager of Le Camping. 10 editions later, the event is now constantly fully booked in a matter of days, proudly showcasing the dozens of CTO/startup couples it’s put together.

If finding a CTO is an essential condition for developing a project, it is also now a mandatory requirement to be accelerated at NUMA. It was, for instance, an “Adopt a CTO” event that brought Nicolas Cosme, developer, together with Tripndrive, a car sharing solution that takes you from the airport to the train station. The team was selected for Le Camping’s 5th season a few months later and has now raised 800 000€ with the ISAI fund, and now offers its services in Charles-de-Gaulle airport, Gare de l’Est train station and many other places all around France. What was once a timid project a CTO/startups speed dating is now considered the Airbnb of car sharing by - no less than - Challenges.
