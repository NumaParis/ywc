#####ACTION
{:.sm-head}

In collaboration with our partner, we build a one day immersive session.
–a first module to “unfold” their minds through presentations and sharing on initiatives from our network. These talks were lead by various profils - mentors, entrepreneurs and investor.
–a second module including a workshop on lean product development. Participants worked on a business problem and went throughout the 3 key concepts: hypothesis approval, MVP and test/iteration.


#####IMPACT
{:.sm-head}

We are currently discussing a long term partnership with Sanofi to train and support their teams in developing new product & services.
