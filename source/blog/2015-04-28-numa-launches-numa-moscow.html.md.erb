*NUMA Moscow: Acceleration à la française to Russia with love*

18 months after opening its doors in Paris, the success of NUMA cannot be denied with 650 startup applications for the acceleration program, over 1500 events and 80 000 visitors. Around half the clients of NUMA’s digital transformation and open innovation programs are CAC40 companies, and 90% of the 72 startups accelerated since the inception of NUMA’s acceleration program in 2011 are thriving. **Today, NUMA is accelerating its own development by opening NUMA Moscow.**

**NUMA Moscow** will give entrepreneurs the opportunity to benefit from 700m2 at the heart of Moscow’s financial center and access to a Russian and French network of private and public actors as well as a trilingual team of 7 people. For French and European startups, NUMA Moscow will be the gateway to a market numbering 150 million consumers. Applications open in June 2015 with the accelerator set to open its doors in September.

**Why Russia?** The potential there for startups is massive: 

- 84 million web users
- the fastest-growing internet and mobile market in Europe (+20% per year)
- over 2000 startups created per year
- excellent locally-sourced technical skills available

Opening NUMA Moscow is the result of over a year’s collaboration with NUMA’s local partner who has been thriving in Russia for nearly a decade: [Ob’vious](http://www.ob-vious.com/?lang=en "O'bvous russian accelerator"){:target="_blank"}

“NUMA is the culmination of fifteen years of experience in the innovation and entrepreneurial sectors. I started out in Russia ten years ago, I know all too well how hard it can be to import an ecosystem and get it growing. NUMA has demonstrated undeniable know-how and talent in this domain, and what they can bring to Russia represents a great opportunity: a strong and recognized brand, proven methods, a real gateway to an international network,” comments Yannick Tranchier, CEO, Ob’vious. 

“The idea behind NUMA Moscow is to create a strong bridge between the French and Russian ecosystems, by sharing startups, mentors, creating hybrid teams… We want to found the first trans-national accelerator. To do this, we first needed the support of a local partner equipped with a strong operational base, an excellent network and real cross-cultural proximity. For these reasons, collaborating with Ob’vious went without saying,” adds Frédéric Oru, Senior Vice President and Head of International Development at NUMA
